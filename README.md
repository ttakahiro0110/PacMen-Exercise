# PacMen-Exercise
https://ttakahiro0110.github.io/PacMen-Exercise/

## Description of Project:
This is a new game with lots of PacMan moving around, bouncing off the walls all with different speeds that you can keep adding more PacMan. You can add PacMan at any time. PacMan will bounce of both the vertical walls and the horizontal walls. And, every PacMan has a random velocity, to begin with, and starts at a random position.

## How to Run:
Click the "Add PacMan" button to add a PacMan. You can add as many as you want at any time. When you are ready, click the "Start Game" button. PacMan will bounce of both the vertical walls and the horizontal walls.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
We plan to add more random colors to each PacMan. Eventually, we are planning to develop a real video game "Pac-Man" in the near future here!
